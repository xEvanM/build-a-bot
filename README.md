# build-a-bot

This project is designed to showcase my learnings following a tutorial on the fundamentals of VueJS by Jim Cooper. 

At each stage of the tutorial I've taken the time to pause, understand and analyse the code and what I am learning.

Included in this course is the Vue.js CLI, Vue.js Components, Inter-component communication, page-to-page routing, stage management and server communication with Vuex, creating custom directives and filters, and deploying vue applications to production.

As of writing and publish to github I still have a lot to do with this project so feel free to follow along and see what I am learning.
